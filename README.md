# 👕 Fashion MNIST Image Classification using Deep Learning

This project implements an image classification model using the **Fashion-MNIST dataset**.  
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained to recognize clothing categories such as shirts, shoes, bags, and more.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:

- Load and preprocess the Fashion-MNIST dataset
- Build a deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras
- Train and evaluate the model
- Predict clothing categories from grayscale images

This is a beginner-friendly computer vision project.

## 🧠 Dataset

Fashion-MNIST contains:

- 60,000 training images  
- 10,000 test images  
- 10 classes  

Each image is **28×28 grayscale**.

Classes include:

- T-shirt/top  
- Trouser
